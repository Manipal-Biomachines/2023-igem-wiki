                       <b>Indole spot test</b>- The Indole spot test was performed with the inoculated culture. A piece of Whatman filter paper was placed in a petri dish cover and saturated with Kovács reagent. The paper was then smeared with cell paste from the culture.There was no visible colour change, indicating a negative result. The organism was confirmed to lack the ability to produce tryptophanase.

                     <p><b>Result</b>: Although the transformed BL21 did not grow as much as the non- transformed, TCC content in the supernatant was measured and it showed less concentration of TCC as compared to the initial concentration in which it was inoculated. The inoculated TCC concentration was observed to be 0.030 OD in LB broth and the final OD was 0.001. However, more experimentation is required to clearly conclude this result.</p>

        TTo prepare 100ppm solution of 3,4-DCA, a degradation byproduct of TCC other than 4-CA;
  1mg of 3,4-DCA is taken and added to 10ml of Acetonitrile
  Further dilution is done to obtain samples of lower concentration.
