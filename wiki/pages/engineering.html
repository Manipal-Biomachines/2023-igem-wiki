        <p class="sub-stuff">The first module of our DBTL cycle shows how our initial project idea shifted on the basis of iHP and testing. </p>

          The team of MIT-MAHE set out to solve the problem of <b>triclocarban entering our environment</b> and causing major issues. We initially identified a novel TccA amidase enzyme expressed in Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2. This amidase had only 27-38% sequence similarity with other known amidases. This enzyme is capable of breaking down triclocarban (TCC) into 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline.[1] <br><br>
          We initially wanted to implement this system within the aeration tank of the wastewater treatment plant. The aim was to increase the enzyme efficiency to function within the hydraulic retention time of the wastewater treatment plant. <br><br>
          Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant is the amount of time taken for one full volume of the aeration tank to pass out of the aeration tank after completion of process. <br>
          HRT=Volume of the aeration tank/flow rate of the water
          Commonly, HRT for <b>conventional activated sludge processes is about 2-24 hours</b>[7].<br><br>
          We wanted to achieve this by modifying amino acid residues through  an in-silico version of site directed mutagenesis.
          We wanted to identify the key residues involved in the catalytic action and improve the binding affinity of the substrate to the enzyme, which we had initially believed might increase the efficiency of the enzyme.

        <p class="sub-stuff">
          The TccA amidase enzyme has not been fully characterized in literature. Therefore, the first step before building our genetic circuit was to understand the structure, binding site and working of the enzyme. <br><br>
          We predicted the structure of the TccA amidase as well as the binding sites. Since most of our data was not obtained via experimentation, our Human practices team reached out to many experts, including Mr. Omkar Khade and Dr. Gurunath Ramanathan, to learn more about the feasibility of our project idea.

                    Through literature survey, we found the catalytic triad of the amidase family to be Ser-Ser-Lys. To identify exactly which triad (Ser-Ser-Lys) of the amidase family was involved, we used multiple alignments.

                    GRASP (collection of tools to perform and analyze ancestral sequence reconstruction) shows the amino acid residues that most probably form the binding pocket of the enzyme. Here, Ser 155 and Ser 179 showed 85% confidence scores showing that it interacts with TCC and Lys 79 with 59% confidence score showing it is not actively involved in bond cleavage but does help in stabilizing the interactions.

            We performed docking studies with the predicted binding site. The docking results from Autodock Vina and SeamDock showed ΔG values of -7.51 kcal/mol and -4.7 kcal/mol respectively. This implies that TCC has a good affinity towards the TccA amidase protein. <br><br>

            These  ΔG values imply that there is a stable binding of TCC to the TccA amidase. This suggests that the predicted binding sites were correct.

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Learn: </u></p>
          <p class="sub-stuff">Through iHP meetings with Mr. Omkar Khade and Dr. Gurunath Ramanathan, we learnt that manually altering the amino acids in close proximity to the catalytic triad requires a comprehensive understanding of the individual functions of each amino acid involved. A random mutagenesis approach would be difficult to perform in-silico as such experiments are usually only performed in-vitro. As a result, we felt the best way forward was to focus on the initial problem statement-dealing with TCC  in wastewater, with an alternative approach.
          </p>

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF" style="text-align:center;">MODULE 1</p>

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Design: </u></p>
          <p class="sub-stuff">

            Ensuring our focus on the problem statement, and taking note of everything learnt in Module 0, we looked back towards our previous human practices interactions. One of the major questions that had been posed to us was the formation of toxic byproducts 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline on biodegrading TCC. Considering these changes, we decided to focus our project on breaking down the TCC into non-toxic byproducts. <br><br>
            Through literature surveys, we studied the presence of gene clusters as a part of other pathways in bacteria that could degrade the above mentioned by-products.
            However, insertion of such large cassettes within known model organisms could cause severe metabolic load on the cell and may lead to stunted growth or loss of plasmid. <br><br>
            Hence, we looked for potential model organisms that had not been characterized for this purpose. An important parameter was the existence of pathways that could degrade the chloroaniline byproducts of TCC breakdown.
            Through extensive literature survey, we narrowed down our possible chassis options to three species capable of degrading the byproducts -<i>Acinetobacter baylyi </i>[3], <i> Pseudomonas putida </i>[4] [5]and <i> Pseudomonas fluorescens </i>[6]. <br>
            All three of these organisms had the natural capability to degrade the toxic by-products. The other major criteria we considered included:
            <ul>
              <li>Survivability of the bacteria in the pH range of the wastewater and sludge(6.5-8)</li>
              <li>Survivability of the bacteria in the temperature range of the sludge tank of the WWTP(20-37° C)</li>
              <li>Survivability at different TCC concentration ranges present in the sludge(13,000-21,000 ng/ml of TCC or 13-21 ppm of TCC)</li></ul><br><br>

              Aim: To design experiments to check which of our three chosen bacterial species: <i>Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> had the best survivability in wastewater treatment plant conditions
              <br><br>
              As TCC does not uniformly dissolve in small volumes of water, we dissolve TCC in acetonitrile at first and then dilute this mixture in water. To ensure that acetonitrile does not have any adverse effect on the growth of our bacteria, we take acetonitrile-containing media as a condition as well.

            <b>Growth Curves</b> To perform these experiments, we inoculated the bacteria in media that simulated the conditions of the sludge tank.The growth was measured by checking the arbitrary units of optical density at 600nm. To convert to absolute units, a calibration curve was plotted for wet weight of the cell vs OD.

            <li>
              <b>pH</b>
              The growth of the bacterial species at pH range of 6 to 8 was growth in LB media.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Temperature</b>
              For temperature studies, we inoculated the bacteria in LB broth media and studied the growth over a temperature range of 24°C to 37°C.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Acetonitrile</b>
               To dissolve and dilute TCC in water, we need to dissolve it in acetonitrile first as TCC has extremely low solubility in water. Since acetonitrile will be in the media that our bacteria grow in, we have to make sure the presence of this compound does not impede the steady growth of our organisms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TCC (Sludge concentration)</b>
              To discern whether our organisms can survive and be effective in the sludge tank, we need to know whether they can survive in the concentration of TCC within the sludge tank and effectively break down this TCC and its constituent degradation products. Hence, we inoculated our bacteria in media containing a range of TCC concentrations that is generally  present in the sludge (13000 - 21000ng\ml).

                      <b>Inference:<b> Presence of TCC at such high concentrations does not inhibit the growth of <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i>. However, the TCC was dissolved in acetonitrile. Our final inference is that the inhibitory effect that existed due to the usage of acetonitrile appeared to be canceled out by the presence of TCC.

                    <li>We found that 30ºC, 7.5 pH were the ideal conditions for growth and surprisingly, the presence of such high concentrations of TCC did not impede its exponential growth. Hence, <i>A. baylyi</i> can proliferate and grow uninhibited in the presence of TCC.</li>

                    <br><br>
                    Due to its ability to proliferate in environments containing near-toxic levels of TCC as well as with all the other parameters that it would be subjected to within the sludge tank of a wastewater treatment plant, we were able to come to the conclusion that <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> is the best choice for our bacterial chassis. The other two bacteria were promptly rejected due to their growth being stunted in the temperature and pH range of the sludge tank.</p>
