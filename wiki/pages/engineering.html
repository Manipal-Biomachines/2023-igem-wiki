        <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Overview: </u></p>
        <p class="sub-stuff">The first module of our DBTL cycle shows how our initial project idea shifted on the basis of iHP and testing. </p>

        <p class="sub-stuff">
          The team of MIT-MAHE set out to solve the problem of <b>triclocarban entering our environment</b> and causing major issues. We initially identified a novel TccA amidase enzyme expressed in Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2. This amidase had only 27-38% sequence similarity with other known amidases. This enzyme is capable of breaking down triclocarban (TCC) into 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline.[1] <br><br>
          We initially wanted to implement this system within the aeration tank of the wastewater treatment plant. The aim was to increase the enzyme efficiency to function within the hydraulic retention time of the wastewater treatment plant. <br><br>
          Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant is the amount of time taken for one full volume of the aeration tank to pass out of the aeration tank after completion of process. <br>
          HRT=Volume of the aeration tank/flow rate of the water
          Commonly, HRT for <b>conventional activated sludge processes is about 2-24 hours</b>[7].<br><br>
          We wanted to achieve this by modifying amino acid residues through  an in-silico version of site directed mutagenesis.
          We wanted to identify the key residues involved in the catalytic action and improve the binding affinity of the substrate to the enzyme, which we had initially believed might increase the efficiency of the enzyme.

        <p class="sub-stuff">
          The TccA amidase enzyme has not been fully characterized in literature. Therefore, the first step before building our genetic circuit was to understand the structure, binding site and working of the enzyme. <br><br>
          We predicted the structure of the TccA amidase as well as the binding sites. Since most of our data was not obtained via experimentation, our Human practices team reached out to many experts, including Mr. Omkar Khade and Dr. Gurunath Ramanathan, to learn more about the feasibility of our project idea.

                    Through literature survey, we found the catalytic triad of the amidase family to be Ser-Ser-Lys. To identify exactly which triad (Ser-Ser-Lys) of the amidase family was involved, we used multiple alignments.

                    GRASP (collection of tools to perform and analyze ancestral sequence reconstruction) shows the amino acid residues that most probably form the binding pocket of the enzyme. Here, Ser 155 and Ser 179 showed 85% confidence scores showing that it interacts with TCC and Lys 79 with 59% confidence score showing it is not actively involved in bond cleavage but does help in stabilizing the interactions.

            We performed docking studies with the predicted binding site. The docking results from Autodock Vina and SeamDock showed ΔG values of -7.51 kcal/mol and -4.7 kcal/mol respectively. This implies that TCC has a good affinity towards the TccA amidase protein. <br><br>

          <p class="sub-stuff">Through iHP meetings with Mr. Omkar Khade and Dr. Gurunath Ramanathan, we learnt that manually altering the amino acids in close proximity to the catalytic triad requires a comprehensive understanding of the individual functions of each amino acid involved. A random mutagenesis approach would be difficult to perform in-silico as such experiments are usually only performed in-vitro. As a result, we felt the best way forward was to focus on the initial problem statement-dealing with TCC  in wastewater, with an alternative approach.

          <p class="mt-5 MAIN-STUFF" style="text-align:center;">MODULE 1</p>

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Design: </u></p>
          <p class="sub-stuff">

            Ensuring our focus on the problem statement, and taking note of everything learnt in Module 0, we looked back towards our previous human practices interactions. One of the major questions that had been posed to us was the formation of toxic byproducts 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline on biodegrading TCC. Considering these changes, we decided to focus our project on breaking down the TCC into non-toxic byproducts. <br><br>
            Through literature surveys, we studied the presence of gene clusters as a part of other pathways in bacteria that could degrade the above mentioned by-products.
            However, insertion of such large cassettes within known model organisms could cause severe metabolic load on the cell and may lead to stunted growth or loss of plasmid. <br><br>
            Hence, we looked for potential model organisms that had not been characterized for this purpose. An important parameter was the existence of pathways that could degrade the chloroaniline byproducts of TCC breakdown.
            Through extensive literature survey, we narrowed down our possible chassis options to three species capable of degrading the byproducts -<i>Acinetobacter baylyi </i>[3], <i> Pseudomonas putida </i>[4] [5]and <i> Pseudomonas fluorescens </i>[6]. <br>
            All three of these organisms had the natural capability to degrade the toxic by-products. The other major criteria we considered included:
            <ul style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #666;">
              <li>Survivability of the bacteria in the pH range of the wastewater and sludge(6.5-8)</li>
              <li>Survivability of the bacteria in the temperature range of the sludge tank of the WWTP(20-37° C)</li>
              <li>Survivability at different TCC concentration ranges present in the sludge(13,000-21,000 ng/ml of TCC or 13-21 ppm of TCC)</li></ul><br><br>
          <p class="sub-stuff">
              Aim: To design experiments to check which of our three chosen bacterial species: <i>Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> had the best survivability in wastewater treatment plant conditions
              <br><br>
              As TCC does not uniformly dissolve in small volumes of water, we dissolve TCC in acetonitrile at first and then dilute this mixture in water. To ensure that acetonitrile does not have any adverse effect on the growth of our bacteria, we take acetonitrile-containing media as a condition as well.

            <b>Growth Curves</b> To perform these experiments, we inoculated the bacteria in media that simulated the conditions of the sludge tank.The growth was measured by checking the arbitrary units of optical density at 600nm. To convert to absolute units, a calibration curve was plotted for wet weight of the cell vs OD.

            <li>
              <b>pH</b>
              The growth of the bacterial species at pH range of 6 to 8 was growth in LB media.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Temperature</b>
              For temperature studies, we inoculated the bacteria in LB broth media and studied the growth over a temperature range of 24°C to 37°C.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Acetonitrile</b>
               To dissolve and dilute TCC in water, we need to dissolve it in acetonitrile first as TCC has extremely low solubility in water. Since acetonitrile will be in the media that our bacteria grow in, we have to make sure the presence of this compound does not impede the steady growth of our organisms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TCC (Sludge concentration)</b>
              To discern whether our organisms can survive and be effective in the sludge tank, we need to know whether they can survive in the concentration of TCC within the sludge tank and effectively break down this TCC and its constituent degradation products. Hence, we inoculated our bacteria in media containing a range of TCC concentrations that is generally  present in the sludge (13000 - 21000ng\ml).

            <u>Plasmid Design</u><br><br>
            The CarbanEl system is based on a Gibson assembly cloning system. The gene fragment is designed and synthesized such that the overhangs to integrate the gene into pET22b+ are already added. For the characterization and study of the enzyme activity, we expressed the amidase gene in <i> E. coli BL21 </i>. However, our final intended chassis is <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i>

            We started with amplifying our tccA fragment and performing PCR clean-up. We isolated pET22b+ plasmid and proceeded with the Gibson Assembly to insert the TccA amidase gene.

          <p class="sub-stuff">The rate expression is related to the rate at which the TccA amidase enzyme from the  <i>Ochrobactrum sp.</i> can degrade TCC. Since our chassis for implementation is <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i>, which is also gram-negative like <i>Ochrobactrum sp.</i>TCC-2, the rate of transport or the passive diffusion of TCC into the cell is assumed to be similar in both bacteria. The rate of degradation of the TCC inside the cell by the TccA amidase enzyme produced by our chassis will be very similar. The time calculated here for 21 PPM (the highest concentration of TCC found in sludge) will be used to model the bioreactor.</p>

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Summary</u></p>
          <p class="sub-stuff">
            As mentioned in our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/mit-mahe/project-implementation">implementation</a>, we aim to introduce a bioreactor in the wastewater treatment plant to treat the primary sludge and clear it of our target contaminant, Triclocarban (TCC). <br><br>
From the results of our previous module of the DBTL cycle, <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> GFJ2 was the most viable choice for a chassis because it had the best growth in high concentrations of TCC and a good survivability for the widely varying conditions of wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, the bacteria has the natural ability to degrade the toxic byproducts produced by the degradation of TCC into non toxic byproducts (cis-muconic acid) that can be taken by the Krebs cycle [3].
          </p>

          <p class="MAIN-STUFF"><u>Design:</u></p>
          <p class="sub-stuff">
            The team came up with multiple bioreactor designs for the implementation of our project that take into account the degradation kinetics of the enzyme, the growth kinetics of the bacteria, and the adsorption kinetics of TCC onto the packing material.<br><br>
            We have currently proposed a lab scale bioreactor due to the fact that we need to conduct further optimisation experiments to upscale into a bioreactor that is feasible on an industrial scale.
          </p>
          <!--insert image of bioreactor-->
          <p class="sub-stuff">
            We wanted to design a sludge based bioreactor where the primary sludge becomes the feed. The primary sludge is almost 97-99% water [4]. We ideated this after a visit to a wastewater treatment plant in West Bengal, India. <br><br>
            We wanted the bacteria that degraded the TCC to be immobilized within a matrix. Literature suggests that cell immobilised systems are far superior to free cell suspensions as it avoids cell washout and improves reaction rates [5]. <br><br>
            We found that biochar, a carbon-rich solid product produced from the pyrolysis of biomass residues, was an attractive option for an immobilisation matrix due to its low cost, easy availability and ability to immobilize cells efficiently[6].<br><br>

                    The packed bed reactor would consist of a packed bed with biochar and immobilized bacteria as packing material between two perforated plates. The primary sludge would enter from the top of the reactor and flow to the bottom with the help of gravity. This eliminates the need for a pump to fill the sludge in the reactor. A sparger at the bottom center would aerate the sludge and would promote a vertical circular flow due to Bernoulli's principle. This will help increase mass transfer efficiency. <br><br>
                    The sparger would have a valve to prevent the backflow of sludge into it, and the sparging would begin before the inflow of sludge into the reactor began. The outlet pipe will also have a valve to prevent sludge from leaving the tank before the specified time. The valve in the inlet pipe is to control the flow rate of the sludge entering the tank. The reactor would be fitted with a pressure gauge to measure and maintain the pressure drop across the reactor. The reactor will be operated in batch mode in unsterile conditions.

                    The continuous flow would be due to the movement of the liquid phase (primary sludge) and gaseous phase (air from the sparger). Both of these factors will induce movement of the solid, i.e., the packing material. The reactor will operate in continuous flow under unsterile conditions.

                    The packing material for the packed and fluidized bed is chemically modified biochar with bacteria immobilized on it. The team decided to make the biochar into the shape of a hollow cylinder called a Raschig ring. This type of structure would increase the area of adsorption and improve mass transfer efficiency. The hollow cylinder pipe-like structure would prevent the problem of choking the reactor due to larger particles that may be present in the sludge. While cylindrical pellets are more commonly used and available, we propose the novel idea of a biochar Raschig ring.

            <li>The packing material would consist of biochar. The biochar will be modified with a 1:1 ratio of biochar to KOH[8]. According to literature, the biochar modified with KOH showed higher adsorption of the target compound TCC compared to other ratios and just plain biochar.</li>
            <li>The biochar would be made into the shape of a Raschig ring using clay as a binding agent. The dimensions of the raschig ring are in the ratio 1:1 of the diameter to the height, and the inside diameter will be 1cm as shown in the figure below.

                    This design would allow us to treat a large amount of sludge in less time. The sparger would provide enough aeration for our bacteria to grow optimally, and degradation would occur efficiently. <br><br>
                    However, according to our adsorption and degradation kinetics the minimum contact time required for efficient degradation of our target contaminant TCC would be 2 days.

                    To overcome the issue of a large amount of packing material required we came up with the design of the CSTR. in this reactor we designed a scaffold that would be 3D printed and placed on the wall of the reactor. The purpose of the scaffold was to hold the biochar in place for adsorption of our target contaminant TCC to occur. <br><br>
                    The stirring would increase the mass transfer efficiency and there would be sufficient aeration because of it as well. However,  this did not solve the issue we had with the contact time and additionally the regeneration of the adsorbent i.e. the biochar proved to be difficult in this case.
                    According to literature, since the degradation of the compound by the enzyme produced by the bacteria is very slow as shown by the kinetics in the <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/mit-mahe/model">models</a> page the type of reactor most suitable for slow reactions was a batch process.

            For a lab scale reactor we will use the batch packed bed reactor. The kinetics of enzyme degradation, TCC adsorption onto the biochar and the bacterial growth kinetics have been fitted into the equations for a batch reactor as given in the <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/mit-mahe/model">models</a> page.<br><br>
            We learnt that design 1 would not be feasible due to low hydraulic retention time of the primary sludge in the tank, hence we tried design 2. However, through a human practices visit with Dr. Subbulaxmi we learnt that the efficiency of the biochar would be reduced significantly.<br><br>
            Design 3 significantly improved contact time; however, it would not be enough to compensate for the low absorption efficiency of the biochar after our other meetings with Dr. Murty. <br><br>
            Design 4 incorporated all the suggestions from Dr. Bhat and Dr. Subbulaxmi and led us to our most ideal design that gave us a high hydraulic retention time of the primary sludge in the tank as well as a high adsorption affinity of the biochar. <br><br>
            However, we learnt from Dr. Kevin Sowers that this model would only be feasible for a lab scale model. Since at industry level we would be required to treat a larger amount of primary sludge per day we proposed design 5 which would have comparable efficiency to design 4 and be able to treat large quantities of sludge due to its larger volume and continuous operation.

          <p class="sub-stuff">
            Our goal was to design a detection system that would go hand in hand with our bioreactor set-up and was accurate, highly sensitive, and cost-effective. In our design stage, we have explored numerous ideas, highlights of which include:
          </p>
            <ul style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #666;">
              <li><i>Electrochemical sensors</i> - were explored, as they are one of the most prevalent detection systems. However, we found that it would not be feasible to achieve the desired selectivity towards triclocarban.</li>
              <li><i>Enzyme based sensors</i>- we identified an enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp.TCC-2; but due to the trace levels of TCC found in effluent this option would not be sensitive enough.</li>
              <li><i>Aptasensors</i>- Aptamers specific for TCC are not available in the literature, due to which, we would be required to isolate and identify one de-novo using SELEX. This is expensive and would not be feasible within our time constraint. </li>
              <li><i>Nanobody based sensors</i>- three nanobodies which were specific to TCC were identified. We realised that immobilizing the nanobody on the sensor and making required modifications would be expensive and within the given time frame, building a prototype and testing didn’t seem like a viable option.</li>
              <li><i>Molecularly imprinted polymer based sensors(MIP)</i>- we found an MIP which would detect triclocarban and triclosan combined. Making an MIP specific to triclocarban in the lab would require extensive experimental data and testing. </li>
              <li><i>Nanomaterial based sensors</i>- Nanomaterial based sensors can detect endocrine disrupting compounds and since TCC is one of them, this drew our attention. However, after thorough literature review we found that there was no nanomaterial isolated specifically for TCC detection. </li>

          <p class="sub-stuff">
            Toward the end, we decided to simplify our approach by using Raman Spectroscopy to identify light of a certain wavelength range specific to TCC and design a simplified prototype of an optical detection system using a laser and  a photodiode to detect this range of wavelengths.

            We used the Raman spectroscopy setup in our secondary PI, Kapil Sadani’s laboratory to conduct experiments and isolate the specific peaks for our compound. Using the data from these experiments, we calculated the specific wavelength for the IR filter and photodiode and built a theoretical set-up that can be employed for the detection of TCC.

The sample would have to be manually collected and brought to this set-up.

            From the experimental data, we learned that the unique peaks (unique wavenumber) for Triclocarban is observed at 758.3 cm<sup>-1</sup>and 1445.2cm<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the second peak observed at 1445.2 cm-1 can be concluded as an overtone of the peak observed at 758.3 cm<sup>-1</sup> as the ratio of the intensities at various concentrations remains constant.
            <br><br>
            In the lake water sample, we noticed peaks within the range of 750 and 760 nanometers.  We can assume that the lake water sample initially had dissolved triclocarban. After experiments with spiked triclocarban were done, we noticed an amplification in the baseline peaks.
            <br><br>
            These preliminary results are indicative of a starting point for proving our proof of concept of a detection system selective and sensitive towards TCC and easily adaptable in all kinds of bioreactor setups.
