    <p class="mt-5 MAIN-STUFF" id="section1"> Introducing Our Human Practices Approach: The IMPACT Framework </p>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff">In our iGEM journey, we have adopted the <b>"IMPACT Framework"</b> as the guiding
      philosophy for our Human Practices endeavors. This holistic framework, rooted in the principles of Ideation,
      Mobilization, Purpose, Adaptation, Collaboration, and Transparency, has shaped how we bridge the gap between
      synthetic biology and real-world challenges.</p>

      <figcaption style="text-align:center"> The “IMPACT” Framework </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff">
      <b>Ideation - Connecting with Local Realities</b><br>
      Our journey began by embracing iGEM's vision of "local people solving local problems". We initiated a deep
      exploration of the issues faced in Manipal, Karnataka, our home ground. By <b>engaging with the local
        community</b> and collaborating with university professors who had previously worked on pressing problems in the
      Udupi district, we embarked on a mission to discover a local issue that our team could tackle with determination
      and dedication. We found out that industrial effluents were discharged near Manipal at the Udyavara River and
      Indrani River, making the water murky and discolored and causing the death of fish in the rivers and its
      tributaries, endangering the people's livelihoods [1]. The polluted rivers contaminated the groundwaters, seeped
      into the wells, and contaminated drinking water, inducing adverse health effects, such as fevers and skin rashes,
      in the local population (reference). While attempting to identify the causative agents for the damage caused, we
      identified many pressing concerns—particularly the accumulation of triclocarban (TCC) in local wastewater
      treatment plants, threatening aquatic life, our coastal fisheries, and our agricultural framework.<br><br>

      <b>Mobilization - Strategic Planning and Resource Allocation</b><br>
      At each stage of our project, we meticulously crafted project plans outlining goals, milestones, and timelines,
      ensuring our efforts were focused and well-coordinated. Recognizing the significance of resources, we <b>mobilized
        the necessary human, financial, and technological assets</b> and conducted meetings online with prominent people
      in protein engineering, synthetic biology, and wastewater treatment. We also proactively addressed potential
      challenges through comprehensive risk assessments, which helped us identify the problem with our initial idea of
      enzyme efficiency enhancement. <br><br>

      <b>Purpose - Alignment with Values and Community Need</b><br>
      Our project remained firmly grounded in our team's core values, iGEM principles, and ethical considerations. We
      actively listened to the needs and concerns of relevant communities, including <b>chemical industries, wastewater
        treatment plants, and the local public</b>. This dialogue allowed us to establish a clear, purpose-driven
      mission benefiting our local community and the environment, establish methods to talk to people about genetically
      modified organisms, and reassess the importance of a kill switch in our project.<br><br>

      <b>Adaptation - Continuous Improvement and Learning</b><br>
      We used adaptability as a guiding principle, allowing us to adjust strategies and tactics based on <b>feedback and
        evolving circumstances</b>. It was often disheartening when we realized that an idea we previously worked on had
      reached a roadblock. However, we fostered a learning culture from our setbacks; our team continuously sought
      growth opportunities. This is how our project evolved from enzyme modification to metabolic engineering followed
      by our final degradation pathway and selection of suitable chassis.<br><br>

      <b>Collaboration - Active Partnerships and Achievement of Goal</b><br>
      Collaboration was central to our approach. By actively <b>seeking partnerships with universities worldwide</b> and
      with external organizations such as non government environmental protection organizations, we utilized these
      partnerships to enhance our project's impact and work towards a greater good. By setting mutually agreeable goals,
      we successfully collaborated with them to accomplish our goals.<br><br>

      <b>Transparency - Open Communication and Accountability</b><br>
      Effective communication was the pillar of our interactions. We maintained <b>open and transparent channels</b>
      within our team and with external stakeholders, fostering clarity and trust. Ethical accountability was
      paramount—we held ourselves responsible for ethical conduct and commitments to our stakeholders. Our thorough
      documentation of the entire process has helped ensure that our insights and knowledge were accessible and usable
      by others.<br><br>

      The <b> "IMPACT Framework" </b> has served as our compass, guiding our team to develop
      innovative solutions that align with our values, address real-world needs, and adapt to changing circumstances.
      Through collaboration and transparency, we have fortified our connections and accountability, ultimately
      magnifying the positive impact of our synthetic biology project.<br><br>

      Sustainable Development Goals
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff"><b>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b>, also known as the Global Goals adopted by
      the United Nations in 2015, aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and
      prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated – they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others and
      that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Throughout our project, we have
      kept these SDGs in mind and worked towards fulfilling them and understanding the interconnectivity of these
      goals.<br><br></p>

    <ul style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #666;">
      <li>Our project considerably advances several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We advance <b>Good Health and
          Well-Being (Goal 3)</b> by designing a novel approach towards the degradation of triclocarban (TCC), a
        hazardous antimicrobial that builds up in wastewater treatment facilities. Both agriculture and aquatic life are
        harmed due to this toxic chemical's presence in water systems. TCC causes endocrine disruption in fish, and when
        the sludge from the WWTP is used as a fertilizer, it affects the yield of the crops. In turn, it can reach
        humans through the food chain.</li>
      <li>Our approach also addresses the buildup of micropollutants in water sources, which aligns with Goal 6:
        <b>Clean Water and Sanitation</b>.</li>
      <li>It embodies <b>Infrastructure, Industry, and Innovation (Goal 9)</b> through the packed bed batch bioreactor
        design for treating TCC in the sludge in sludge treatment plants (STPs). </li>
      <li>Along with that, we support <b>Sustainable Communities and Cities (Goal 11)</b> by raising awareness about
        harmful chemicals in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their impact on urban areas.</li>
      <li><b>Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12)</b> by spreading awareness about the presence of harmful
        chemicals in PPCPs through our education drives and talks and promoting that the labels on products should be
        read before buying PPCPs.<br></li>
      <li>By proposing our solution to degrade triclocarban in wastewater, we are improving <b>Life On Land</b> and
        <b>Life Below Water (Goals 14 and 15)</b> by taking a step towards preventing the harm caused to agriculture,
        aquatic life, and human health.</li>
      <li>Besides, we have prepared synthetic biology-related content for varying age groups and interacted with
        students to educate them, ensuring that <b>Quality Education (Goal 4)</b> is fulfilled. </li>
      <li>We have also reached out to underprivileged children and specially-abled people to make science accessible to
        everybody, whether they are a part of the scientific community or not, thus meeting <b>Goal 10 (Reduced
          Inequalities)</b>. </li>
      <li>We have been encouraging collaborations with various institutions and NGOs for value education and maximum
        reach to the community throughout our project <b>(Goal 17-Partnership For Goals)</b>.</li>

      Stakeholder Approach
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff">The effect of any project or product can only be impactful if the project's stakeholders
      are kept in mind during the design process. Stakeholders will be affected by the implementation of a project or
      can assist in developing the project such that the implementation adheres to environmental and scientific
      guidelines; this helps us understand <b>how our project impacts the world and how the world impacts our

    <p class="sub-stuff">Instead of creating a general SWOT analysis for our project we conducted a SWOT analysis for
      each of our five stakeholder categories. A generalized stakeholder analysis would have given us a breakdown of who
      our stakeholders are. However, since we had already identified our stakeholders, we used this categorized SWOT
      analysis. Using our <b>stakeholder-specific SWOT analysis</b>, we prepared questions and approached stakeholders
      accordingly. We used the analysis to weigh the inputs given by the stakeholders and focussed on the weaknesses and
      threats to analyze <b>the necessity of integrating their opinions into our project</b> and how to explore further
      opinions within the same stakeholder category.<br><br></p>

              exploring the Fenton catalyst for degradation, <b>examining TCC solubility</b>, and using LCMS and HPLC
              for estimation. Our discussion also highlighted the inefficiencies of existing treatment methods in

              We gained valuable insights during our project discussion with Dr. Shetty. As his research centers on
              addressing environmental challenges, his input was particularly relevant to our work. He recommended
              visiting our <b>local community's wastewater treatment plants</b> to understand their operational
              processes better.<br>
              Dr. Shetty also provided specific advice related to our implementation mechanism. He suggested
              implementation methods like activated carbon, sequencing batch reactor, and membrane reactor. Further, he
              mentioned the WHO standards which should be taken into account while designing our project. Additionally,
              he even offered to arrange industry wastewater samples for our wet lab testing needs.<br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Based on the advice and suggestions given by Dr. Shetty, we designed our implementation process keeping in
              mind that it doesn't harm the environment. The discussion with him about the <b>types of bioreactors</b>
              for sludge treatment was also useful in the later stages of the project.

              During our discussion with Mr. Khade regarding our goal to increase the efficiency of the enzyme to
              degrade the target, he expressed that we must look beyond enzyme docking and conduct in-vitro studies. For
              experimental purposes, he advised us to establish a standard curve using samples with known concentrations
              of Triclocarban (TCC). He outlined a methodology for preparing for the same. It was essential to conduct
              all experiments in replicates to ensure greater accuracy. To assess the enzyme's impact on these samples,
              we could extract equal volumes from them at regular intervals. HPLC or LCMS could measure the quantity of
              products generated or the <b>extent of substrate degradation</b>. Mr. Khade encouraged us to consult the
              Michaelis–Menten kinetics rate equation and explore relevant research papers.<br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Mr. Khade's guidance was instrumental in conducting wet lab studies for TCC detection. We conducted
              iterative experimentation as suggested and created multiple samples of varying TCC concentrations to
              create a standard curve using a UV-visible spectrometer. We also used the Michaelis-Menten rate equation
              to study the <b>degradation kinetics</b> of our bioreactor design later in the project.<br>

              Our meeting with Dr. Paul occurred when we were in the nascent stages of our project, using computational
              methodologies to improve the amidase enzyme. Dr. Bobby Paul guided us during this phase. He suggested that
              we study different versions of the TccA amidase enzyme to help create a better one. He also advised us to
              explore alternative organisms besides <i>Ochrobactrum sp.</i> that might have a more proficient amidase to
              break down triclocarban (TCC). He introduced us to a software tool called Polyphen, which is adept at
              introducing mutations into enzymes and predicting their resultant structural conformations. He also
              encouraged us to learn about enzyme kinetics for our project.<br>
              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Even though our initial project idea changed, Dr. Paul’s inputs turned out to be instrumental in our
              ideation stage. We looked into alternative organisms on his suggestion, and that helped us ensure that we
              had made the right choice.

                <b>12/05/2023</b><br><br>

                <i>Discussion:</i><br>
                We reached out to Dr. Tiwari, intending to discuss various techniques for detecting triclocarban (TCC).
                During our conversation, he suggested implementing <b>microcontrollers and paper microfluidics as
                  potential avenues.</b><br>
                Furthermore, he highlighted the significance of delving into TCC's distinctive electrical properties and
                molecular structure. Such an approach could enhance the sensor's specificity to TCC. Dr. Tiwari also
                floated the idea of investigating specific chemical reactions triggered by TCC, which could manifest as
                observable color changes. Harnessing these reactions, he posited, could serve as the foundation for
                constructing our sensor.<br><br>

                <i>Inference:</i><br>
                On Dr. Tiwari’s suggestion, we looked into the color changing properties and chemical reactions
                triggered by TCC. However, we could not find any data on it and hence, he helped us <b>rule out
                  colorimetric and electrochemical sensors</b>. After this, we moved on to enzyme-based biosensors to
                detect TCC<br><br>

                Our discussion with Ms. Shreya was initiated with a focus on elevating the binding energy of our enzyme
                and understanding its direct relationship with degradation efficiency. The conversation then shifted
                towards our goal of enhancing the stability and efficiency of our modified enzyme. Shreya discussed
                utilizing the Kcat/Km equation and Michaelis-Menten equations for analyzing enzyme efficiency. This
                process included creating standard curves, detecting TCC levels, and calculating product concentrations.
                Shreya emphasized the importance of running control samples, performing statistical analysis, and

              Akshara Gopinath, an expert in environmental resources management, shared invaluable insights during our
              discussion. Akshara highlighted the absence of concrete regulations on GMO usage in wastewater treatment
              plants and recommended exploring European Union (EU) rules as a reference point. She also emphasized the
              significance of examining health and safety standards, notably the International Finance Corporation (IFC)

              emissions, waste emissions, scalability, and project costs. She underlined that the Pollution Control
              Board would likely require an environmental impact assessment for our project. To engage with the
              community, Akshara encouraged us to initiate discussions with NGOs, municipal bodies, and educational
              institutions to raise awareness and foster the acceptance of GMOs in our project. Given the existing
              reservations around GMOs, she stressed the importance of transparency in sharing the results of safety

              <i>Discussion:</i><br>
              With Dr. Ramanathan's expertise in enzymology, the interaction with him was instrumental to our project.
              Not only did he spot <b>inconsistencies in our proposed degradation pathway</b>, which needed a fixture,
              but he also advised us to survey the toxicity of byproducts formed using the amidase. He mentioned that we
              should explore the role of metal ions and other cofactors in enzyme catalysis, try to superimpose urease
              with amidase and find the data for hydrolysis of TCC. He informed us about how metal ions play an
              essential role in the catalytic activity of an enzyme. Citing and recommending Tinkering With Enzymes by
              Jermy R Knowles, he stated that the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme interacting with its native
              substrate cannot be increased. Catalytic efficiency is inherently at its maximum. To understand protein
              folding better, he suggested we read Richard Dawkins's Blind Watchmaker as well.<br><br>

              <b>12/06/23</b><br><br>

              In the subsequent meeting with him, we discussed the material he suggested we go through. We proposed the
              following methods to improve enzyme efficiency: replacing one amino acid with an isosteric residue of a
              different function or replacing one amino acid with another of identical functions, resulting in a
              different structure. Unfortunately, we concluded that it would be difficult to increase the efficiency of
              the amidase as modification of the residues will harm the enzyme's function. <b>Nature by itself ensures
                that absolute efficiency is achieved and no product goes wasted, and trying to increase it given our
                constraints was an unrealistic expectation.</b><br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              His insights caused a significant shift in our project approach, where we changed our focus from <b>enzyme
                modification to a novel biodegradation pathway for TCC</b> such that it breaks down to form non-toxic
              products that enter the TCA metabolic cycle.<br>

              Mr. Sotiris suggested incorporating machine learning to optimize the direct evolution process. He advised
              that we tweak the enzyme sequence through amino acid modification and docking simulations. He stressed the
              need for in vitro lab techniques and validation of our in-silico results in the wet lab. The possibility
              of using <b>two enzymes to degrade TCC into non-toxic products like cis muconic acid</b> was first
              introduced by him, and he considered it to be a better approach than modifying the amidase enzyme to
              increase its efficiency.<br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Mr Sotiris's suggestion of using two enzymes to degrade TCC made us look into the complete degradation of
              TCC into non-toxic byproducts using multiple enzymes. <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i>, <i>Pseudomonas
                putida</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> are the most favorable options to degrade the toxic
              byproducts of TCC, hence completing our degradation pathway.<br>

              We visited two wastewater treatment plants located in the Manipal region. These visits were instrumental
              in gaining practical insights into the treatment processes. The resident engineers generously shared their
              expertise at the first wastewater treatment plant, which exclusively processed domestic wastewater. They
              provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the sequential steps involved in water purification.
              This clarity was precious for us as we intended to target the aeration tank in our project. During our
              discussion, the engineers emphasized the <b>duration that one cubic meter (1m³) of water</b> typically
              spends within the aeration tank, shedding light on a critical parameter for our project planning. Notably,
              the engineers stressed the significance of maintaining a stable bacterial ecosystem within the aeration

              <i>Discussion:</i><br>
              During our meeting with Mr. Rajesh Kanungo, we discussed our project and the possible consequences of TCC
              (triclocarban) on aquatic life, agriculture, and human health. One key point during our conversation was
              the use of TCC as an antimicrobial agent. However, Mr. Rajesh mentioned that his company doesn’t use this
              compound. He explained that incorporating an antimicrobial like TCC into their products would require
              obtaining a Drug License, which involves an entirely different set of regulatory procedures.<br><br>

              <i>Inference</i><br>
              We had noticed how larger companies have started phasing out the use of TCC. This discussion highlighted
              that <b>even smaller companies are gradually trying to phase out the use of TCC in their products now</b>.
              However, there are companies that are still using TCC as an antimicrobial agent. The removal of TCC from

              <i>Discussion:</i><br>
              With his expertise in different types of WWTPs, Mr. Barik provided valuable insights into the design and
              distinctions of ETPs and STPs. Mr. Barik had not previously encountered information about TCC
              (triclocarban) but was familiar with the concept of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). One of the
              critical aspects we discussed was <b>TCC's adverse impact on the efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in
                WWTPs that play a major role in ammonia degradation</b>. Our proposed implementation was in the aeration
              tank of the WWTP. Here, Mr. Barik suggested an alternative approach that we implement our solution in the
              equalization tank before the aeration tank. This equalization tank is where various pre-treatment
              processes, including pH maintenance, are addressed. By doing so, we could prevent the harmful effects of
              TCC on the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the aeration tank.<br><br>
              <i>Inference</i><br>
              This meeting with Mr. Barik proved to be highly informative, offering us a fresh perspective on the
              <b>optimal placement of our solution within WWTPs</b>. On looking further into this, we came up with the
              idea of implementing our project in our designed bioreactor.<br><br>

              During our visit to Garden Reach Water Works, we were guided by Mr. P.K. Das, an Executive Engineer with
              expertise in Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Water Treatment Plants (WTPs). Mr. P.K. Das gave us a
              comprehensive tour of the WWTP, offering valuable insights into its operations. Even though the sewage
              treatment plant was not operational during our visit, Mr. P.K. Das elaborated on the crucial
              considerations of its construction. We learned that the sewage treatment plant had a 45 Minimal Liquid
              Discharge capacity and contained 500 mg/L of dissolved solids. Additionally, we discovered that primary

              During our meeting with Dr. Sudhir, we discussed managing the <b>metabolic load within engineered
                metabolic pathways</b>. He highlighted the intricacies of releasing engineered strains and how they can
              trigger significant environmental and health concerns among the general public. In the context of India,
              Ankit drew our attention to The Environmental Protection Act, which outlines specific restrictions
              concerning engineered organisms in the country. Notably, he mentioned that India has recently approved the
              release of CRISPR-edited plants. Leveraging this genetic engineering method for mutagenesis testing could
              streamline obtaining <b>permissions from local government authorities</b>. Dr. Ankit concluded our meeting
              by suggesting <b>re-evaluating our chosen enzymes</b> and exploring superimposable structures that might

              During our visit to the BWSSB Waste Water treatment plant, we explored the three critical phases of
              wastewater treatment: primary, secondary, and tertiary.<br>
              In the primary phase, they showed us how raw sewage is pre-treated to remove large debris and floating
              materials. They also showed us that the secondary phase involves bacteria breaking down organic matter,
              followed by disinfection for non-drinking purposes. Viewing the tertiary treatment phase introduced us to
              advanced techniques like reverse osmosis (RO) and Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR). We also discussed how
              the treatment method choice depends on sewage quality and intended use. For example, SBR is excellent at
              removing pollutants like nitrogen.<br>
              A notable point of discussion was the significant amount of <b>untreated wastewater which is often used
                for agricultural irrigation</b> in Bangalore. <br>


              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              This discussion raised concerns about the environmental impact, especially regarding the <b>presence of

              Dr. George helped us understand the various possible TCC detection and quantification methods. He
              mentioned that Raman spectrometry has high specificity compared to other methods. The use of near-infrared
              (NIR) spectrometry was discussed but soon dropped since it would be unable to detect TCC at ppb levels in
              the effluent, thus giving a broad range spectrum. He brought to our notice that mass spectrometry would be
              the most preferred method for quantifying TCC and its daughter compounds. He also pointed out that, in our
              case, <b>liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) would work better than gas chromatography-mass
                spectrometry (GC-MS)</b>, which is better suited for volatile substances.<br><br>

              <i>Inference</i><br>
              The discussion with Dr. George was fruitful in understanding the pros and cons of various methods that
              could be used for TCC detection. Based on his insights and as suggested by other stakeholders earlier as

                the more critical for us to solve this problem as a high priority. He explained how hypothesizing <b>the
                  degradation of other compounds along with TCC due to our modified bacteria</b> would add more value to
                our project, giving it a better global impact. Apart from this, he also mentioned that LCMS would be
                ideal for TCC quantification in water. He enlightened us about LCMS QTOF (Quadrupole Time of Flight),
                which would be more suitable for quantifying the daughter compounds 4-CA and 3,4-DCA.<br><br>

                <i>Inference:</i><br>
                His suggestion pushed us to explore the <b>degradation of other anilines, herbicides, and pesticides</b>

              The All India iGEM Meet (AIIM) hosted by the iGEM team of IISER Bhopal took place at the end of July. A
              mock Jamboree presentation was held where all teams presented their projects followed by a poster
              presentation on the next day. During the presentation, the questions asked by the judges prompted us to
              think of new aspects of the project and how to improve upon it. Further, the interactions with other teams
              allowed us to understand and learn from other projects.<br>
              The judges were very accepting of the idea of <b>biochar as a matrix</b> but were concerned about the
              selectivity of the matrix in adsorbing triclocarban. Further, they mentioned that wastewater would contain
              sufficient carbon sources and that the bacteria may or may not utilize TCC. They also believed that the
              delivery of our project could be made to be more impactful. <br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              The discussion caused us to start looking deeply into the delivery of our project and the work done.
              Later, we found that <b><i>Ochrobactrum sp.</i> constitutively expressed tccA</b> in nature. The TCC
              enters the cell through passive transport, allowing it to utilize it as a carbon source. <br>

              As many of our wet lab protocols require us to work with the toxic chemicals triclocarban,
              4-chloroaniline, and 3,4-dichloroaniline, we wanted to check the suitability of our safety protocols. The
              wet lab team met Lynn, who explained how raising health and safety issues and talking to people in the
              workplace regarding safety were necessary.<br>
              She suggested using a <b>fume hood with carbon filter respirators</b> while preparing stock solutions of
              triclocarban. She also approved our existing use of gloves and safety goggles. She also suggested using
              <b>double gloves</b> if we did not have the required glove thickness. She emphasized the importance of
              wiping all counters and workspaces with soap and water every evening. She also stated the importance of
              going through the 4 °C fridge, throwing out all unwanted samples, and defrosting the -20 °C fridge once a
              month.<br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              The session with Lynn was very insightful, and we considered many of her suggestions. Even though they
              seem like simple lab safety ideas, they have helped us <b>better our lab environment and conduct our
                experiments more efficiently</b>.<br>

              Dr. Ramachandran Murty is helping our team with designing our bioreactor model. He gave us valuable input
              on how we could design the bioreactor having <b>TCC as a rate-limiting substrate</b> while ignoring other
              compounds that may be present in the wastewater. Dr. Murty also said that the <b>fouling of the packed bed
                can be ignored while working on a lab scale</b>. Further, he recommended that we utilize a pair of
              sequential batch reactors to address the issue of the duration for which the sludge must remain in the
              reactor. He also advised us to incorporate a sparger to help with sludge aeration, thus supporting the
              growth of our microbe, which is aerobic.<br>

              While doing mathematical calculations, we were concerned about the fouling of the packed bed. However, Dr.
              Murty’s suggestion that the fouling can be ignored at the lab scale was helpful for us and <b>simplified

              We designed a 2D diagram of a batch-stirred tank reactor and a batch-packed bed reactor and showed it to
              Dr. Bhat. He found the idea of a batch-packed bed reactor more feasible and mentioned that if the size of

              solvent like <b>hexane to regenerate the packing material</b> as it is affordable and safe for the
              environment and organisms. It would also vaporize quickly due to its high volatility. He also provided us
              with a biochar sample made out of <b>locally grown rice husk</b>. It is produced as a waste product by the
              burning of rice husks to generate energy in rice mills.<br><br>

              <i>Discussion:</i><br>
              Our team took part in the Smart India Hackathon conducted by our University. One of our main aims in
              participating in this hackathon is to get more insights from the judges regarding the hardware component
              of our project. We designed a 2D model of our detector, which consisted of the Raman setup with a
              photodiode. These samples will also be sent to the Raman-diode setup for detection and quantification. The
              judges suggested we <b>collect two samples to quantify TCC</b>, one before the primary sludge enters the
              bioreactor and the other after it leaves the bioreactor. For the detection and quantification of TCC, we
              would require a Signal Processing Unit (SPU) that could filter the peaks corresponding to other compounds
              in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). <br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Based on the judges’ inputs, we decided to go ahead with a photo-diode based detector. Two samples would
              be <b>collected manually at the entry point and the exit point two days later</b> to understand the
              variation in the concentration of TCC.<br>

              <i>Discussion:</i><br>
              After the insightful meeting with Mr. Swain on July 6, we went back to him to get his inputs on our
              bioreactor design. Being an expert in the design of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), Mr. Swain
              confirmed that our proposed physical design of the bioreactor is sound. He gave us a general idea of what
              <b>materials to use to make the bioreactor</b>, the workings of a WWTP, and the most commonly used parts
              in the system. He gave us a couple of ideas on how to pick a material for the bioreactor—something that is
              unreactive, cheap, and readily available. He also gave us a few sample diagrams of WWTPs that he had
              designed for our reference.<br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              After discussing with him, we got a fair idea about the components of a WWTP and applied that knowledge to
              carry out the cost analysis of our bioreactor. Hence, we decided that our bioreactor would need to be
              placed <b>after the aeration tank in the WWTP</b>.<br>

              During our meeting with Dr. Mike, we raised the concern that we could not find specific plasmid vectors
              for our chassis <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i>. He approved of our idea of going ahead with pet22b(+) and
              suggested using high amounts of cells and DNA to increase the chances of the bacteria taking up the
              plasmid. Since <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> has variable transformation rates, he asked us to understand
              the transformation rate of our strain. If replating is done repeatedly, the phenotype might change,
              lowering the transformation rates. He advised us to always work directly with glycerol stock, avoid
              plating it, and work with a single colony. He also suggested using Gibson Assembly for transformation of
              our bacteria. <br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              The insightful discussion with Dr. McDonald helped us finalize our plasmid vector pET22b(+). Further, his
              suggestions regarding the plating procedure turned out to be of utmost importance.<br>

              In our meeting with Dr. Sowers, we discussed the packing material in our bioreactor. We plan on using

                structures would require support</b> to handle the mechanical stresses. Hence, a binding agent would be
                required to maintain the structure of the raschig ring. For example, he mentioned using clay to bind
                ceramide pellets in one of his projects. He mentioned that we could use PVC for the pipes to transport
                the sludge in and out of the reactor, and the reactor could be a polypropylene tank.<br>

              <i>Discussion:</i> <br>
              We had been referring to Dr. Krishnaiah’s NPTEL course on “Chemical Reaction Engineering” [2] to take
              inspiration for our bioreactor design. It is through this course that we realized the need to pack our
              biochar as raschig rings in order to increase the surface area and prevent choking. Furthermore, we wanted
              to get his insights on our project in particular and hence, we requested him for a meeting. After
              explaining our bioreactor model to Dr Krishnaiah, he found it feasible and gave us some suggestions. He
              mentioned that a valve should be put on the sparger to <b>prevent the backflow of fluid into the
                sparger</b> and to start the sparger before the inflow of the fluid to prevent backflow. He suggested we
              opt for a fluidized bed on an industrial scale as it would have a better flow with less packing material
              and provide an efficient mass transfer. Further we spoke to him about our raschig ring dimensions and the
              calculations associated with them, and he approved of our idea and the calculations proposed.<br><br>

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              We decided to incorporate his insights regarding the sparger into our bioreactor design. Although we plan
              on carrying out our experiments on a packed bed on a lab scale, we would proceed with <b>a fluidized bed
                for future industry implementation</b>. Based on his inputs, we assumed our biochar raschig rings to be
              having a <b>Length/Diameter ratio as 1</b>.<br>

              After the session by Ms. Olivia Gallup on “Computational Methods in Synthetic Biology”, we presented a
              detailed overview of our project to her and engaged in a comprehensive discussion. This discussion was
              vital in helping us <b>devise a more feasible approach for controlling our genetic circuit</b>. We
              discussed the concept of gene knockout in the context of kill switches to create an auxotrophic bacteria
              using a CRISPR system. This discussion helped us consider the impact of genetic modifications on our
              system's functionality. A significant focus of our conversation was assessing the availability of
              <b>computational tools</b> to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed "kill switch." We were
              particularly interested in understanding how this switch would affect our genetic components. Olivia
              provided valuable information on computational tools that could be used to model the genetic circuit and

              <i>Discussion:</i> <br>
              The discussion with Dr. Mahesha mainly revolved around Raman spectroscopy. He suggested varying the power
              of the Raman spectrometer with the same sample to observe the change in intensity of the Raman signals.
              Ideally, only the intensity would undergo change. This could be used to mitigate noise in the
              spectroscopic data. He emphasized that not all molecular vibrations would contribute to the Raman shifts.
              He advised an <b>intensity vs. concentration</b> calibration graph, where intensity would be plotted on
              the y-axis and concentration on the x-axis. An infrared (IR) filter to <b>eliminate the infrared range</b>
              that may act as an interference and explore diode lasers for constructing our sensor was also suggested by
              him .

              <i>Inference:</i><br>
              Because of the suggestions provided by Dr. Mahesha, we realized that varying the power of the spectrometer
              with the same sample to reduce noise and creating an intensity vs. concentration calibration graph would
              make our <b>data more accurate and reliable</b>. Using an IR filter and diode lasers would further ensure
              <b>the precision of our sensor</b>.<br>

        to lack of concern observed from the responses on the survey.</li>
      <li>Education for the working class was tailored according to their responses from the survey as most of the
        respondents were assumed to be working class due to their educational qualifications. Participants responded
        that they didn’t want to learn more about GMOs, however when the same concept was explained without the use of
        the term GMO most participants seemed more open and accepting towards the concept as well as our project.</li>

    <p class="mt-5 MAIN-STUFF" id="section6">How our discussions lead to the Final Implementation</p>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff"><b>Proposed Implementation</b></p>

    <p class="mt-5 sub-stuff">With the use of a modified <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> strain, we have proposed a packed
      bed bioreactor in our study to effectively break down the toxic chemical triclocarban (TCC) into non-toxic
      molecules. This strain has undergone genetic modification to express the tccA gene, which produces the TccA
      amidase enzyme that converts TCC to 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline. The natural metabolic pathway of
      <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> has also been utilized to transform these chloroaniline daughter compounds into
      cis-muconic acid, a secure end product that may be included into the bacterial energy supply by taking part in the
      TCA metabolic cycle.<br><br>

      <i>Bioreactor Design:</i><br>
      Our bioreactor design, as discussed previously, incorporates a packed bed configuration that facilitates effective
      contact between fluids and solids. This design remains instrumental in ensuring efficient TCC degradation.<br>
      <i>Choice of Packing Material:</i><br>
      We continue to utilize the locally sourced biochar from rice husks, in line with Dr. Bhat's recommendation, as an
      ideal packing material that provides both adsorption properties and a nutrient-rich environment for the modified
      <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> strain.<br>
      <i>Environmental Considerations:</i><br>
      Incorporating control samples into our growth curve experiments, as suggested by Dr. Shetty, ensures data
      reliability and environmental safety, especially considering the by-products of TCC degradation.<br>
      <i>Novel Biodegradation Pathway:</i><br>
      Dr. Ramananthan's inputs on a novel biodegradation pathway for TCC play a pivotal role in our project's success,
      shifting our initial idea of enzyme efficiency enhancement to an idea that was more feasible in our given timeline
      and resources. <br>
      <i>Choice of Microbe:</i><br>
      Mr. Sotiris' recommendation to employ multiple enzymes for complete TCC degradation complements our bacterial
      strain's capabilities.<br>
      <i>Application in Sludge Treatment Plants (STPs):</i><br>
      Mr. S.K. Swain's guidance on implementing our solution in STPs remains a key aspect, considering the higher TCC
      concentration in sludge.<br>
      <i>Regeneration of Biochar:</i><br>
      Varying the power of the spectrometer, creating an intensity-concentration calibration graph, and using hexane for
      biochar regeneration, as per Dr. Mahesha MG and Dr. Bhat's recommendations enhance our project's accuracy and
      sustainability.<br>
      <i>Future Implementation:</i><br>
      Our future plans, as guided by Dr. Kevin, to use clay or lignin as a binding agent for the biochar Raschig rings
      further strengthen the integrity of our packing material.<br>
      <i>Advanced Monitoring with LCMS:</i><br>
      The discussion with Dr. George to weigh the pros and cons of all the TCC quantification ideas and realizing that
      the use of LCMS for compound quantification is the most efficient method enhances our project's analytical
      capabilities.<br>
      <i>Fluidized Bed Bioreactor:</i><br>
      Dr. Krishnaiah's insights on fluidized bed bioreactors (for future implementation) will aid our project's
      scalability and efficiency.<br>
      <i>Bioreactor Placement:</i><br>
      S.K. Swain's guidance on bioreactor placement after the aeration tank in WWTPs is essential for optimal
      performance.<br>
      <i>Mathematical Modeling Simplification:</i><br>
      Dr. Murty's assurance that fouling can be ignored at the lab scale simplifies our mathematical modeling
      efforts.<br><br>

      By integrating these additional scientific insights into our project implementation, we hope to ensure a
      comprehensive approach to efficient TCC degradation while prioritizing environmental responsibility.<br><br>
