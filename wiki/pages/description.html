            <p> Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) like cosmetics, soaps, disinfectants and detergents are composed of a plethora of chemical classes including antimicrobial compounds. Triclocarban (TCC) is a popularly incorporated antimicrobial since it prevents product spoilage and infection to the consumer. </p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p> PPCPs containing these compounds are consumed globally at a rate of 0.1 million tonnes per year and often find their way into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) through washing, direct disposal, or human excreta (as parent compounds, conjugated compounds, or metabolites) [1]. However, due to its high hydrophobicity and chemical stability, TCC in these products is difficult to degrade completely once flushed off into the WWTPs, and 76-79% of TCC is released with sewage sludge. [2] </p>

            <p> <br><br><br>At local WWTPs in Udupi, India, and Mangalore, India, the average concentration of TCC recorded in the sludge was 21,000 ng/g dw and 13,000 ng/g dw, respectively [3].  The concentration of TCC detected in Indian aquatic environments (including surface waters or even drinking water) was 1119 ng/L [2]. <br><br><br><br> On a global scale, the median values of detected TCC in surface water worldwide ranged around 10-100 ng/L. 51-347 ng/L and 7.5-102 ng/L TCC were monitored in tap and treated drinking water, respectively. [4] <br><br><br> TCC is omnipresent and preserved in environments and even found to accumulate within our flora and fauna, causing hormone disruption. TCC can also threaten human health and has been linked to blood toxicity and disruptions in endocrine activity. </p>

Among majorly affected species, <br><br><br> Exposure to 5-10 mg/L of TCC for 21 days reduced mobility, feeding, aggression, fecundity or even caused death in fathead minnows. [2] <br><br></p>

                <p style="color:#87CEEB"> Zebrafish larvae were also victims. 6.6 microg/L of TCC altered the expression of proteins related to nervous system development and immune response, binding and metabolism, skeletal muscle development, and function. When exposed to higher concentrations, Zebrafish larvae experienced inhibited heart rate, delayed yolk absorption and swim bladder development, and thyroid hormone. [2] <br><br><br> TCC has endocrine-disrupting properties that cause reproductive effects in freshwater mud snails, planktonic crustaceans, and amphibians. [2] </p>

                <p style="color:#87CEEB"> <br><br><br><br><br>In food crops cultured in hydroponic media, after 4 (four) weeks of exposure, roots accumulated 86–1,350 mg kg−1 of antimicrobials and shoots had accumulated 0.33-5.35 mg kg−1 of antimicrobials including triclocarban. [6] <br><br><br> The uptake and accumulation of TCC due to the use of contaminated biosolids has been detected in several food crops —carrots, green peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers—and has been proven to hinder proper metabolism in the crops. [2] <br><br><br> TCC accumulation was also detrimental to soil quality. As an antimicrobial, it may participate in antibiotic resistance bacteria selection and may induce antibiotic-resistant genes in these bacteria. </p>

                <p style="color:#87CEEB; font-size: 25px>"> <br><br><br>Adsorption is the most prevalent physical approach to removing triclocarban (TCC) from water, but there is room for improvement in its operational parameters. Additionally, desorption should be considered to ensure sustainable water treatment. Although activated carbon adsorption has been considered, its disadvantages include high costs, lack of selectivity, and a limited regenerative capacity [7] <br><br><br>  In the case of chemical methods, Ultraviolet light (UV), chlorine oxidation, ozone, and electron-Fenton are usually considered promising methods. Inorganic ions, like sulfate and nitrate, often found in wastewater, were found to hinder the photolysis of TCC by UV radiation [8]. Chlorine oxidation often results in the incomplete degradation of the compounds and the production of hazardous byproducts. Chemical approaches are generally more expensive, while ozone-based techniques have been proven to be less effective. It was found that most methods currently utilized by WWTPs in India aren’t adequate for removing TCC. [2] </p>

                <p style="color:#87CEEB; font-size: 25px"> <br><br><br> We plan on using multiple enzymes in tandem, TCC-2 from Ochrobactrum sp., which degrades TCC, and a few others to degrade its toxic byproducts, which finally form non-toxic daughter compounds that enter the TCA metabolic cycle. Moreover, to improve its efficiency, we plan to mutate TCC-2. This will effectively lower the impact of TCC on our environment, and in the affected sectors of aquaculture, agriculture, and human health. Hence, our enzyme(s) would degrade this compound into harmless by-products in the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant, avoiding the impact as mentioned above in the real world.<br><br><br> We plan to integrate biocontainment strategies and kill switches into our project design, aiming to address concerns regarding the safe and responsible use of genetically modified enzymes. As a detection method, we aim to develop a biosensor to quantify TCC concentration. These measures will help prevent unintended environmental release, protecting aquatic ecosystems and human health while effectively degrading triclocarban in wastewater treatment plants.</p>

                <p style="color:#87CEEBL; font-size: 22px"> <br><br> Our inspiration for the project was primarily through a professor from our university, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Dr. K. Balakrishna, who elucidated the incomplete degradation of antimicrobials in the wastewater treatment plants. On researching further, we came across triclocarban and the extent of its toxicity across biospheres.<br><br><br>Udupi, a coastal city in Karnataka, India, recorded high concentrations of triclocarban (540 ng/L) in its local water bodies. According to a study by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Udupi generates approximately 13 million liters of wastewater daily, of which triclocarban (TCC) levels were up to 6.4 mg/L. [9, 13] Literature indicates that this concentration of TCC is capable of causing chronic and acute toxicity for fish. [10, 11]. The high concentrations of TCC in local areas have led to adverse effects on aquatic organisms, including disruption of hormone systems and reproductive abnormalities. <br><br><br> Globally, triclocarban has been detected in various water bodies, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. Studies have revealed the presence of TCC in over 58% of the water samples collected from 33 countries, highlighting the need for effective wastewater treatment methods to prevent further contamination of water bodies.
